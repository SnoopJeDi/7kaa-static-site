        	<h3><a href="#entry-0">#</a> With your friends</h3>
        	<p> The game supports playing with up to 7 players over the internet. Are you ready to try your skill against other opponents? You'll have many of your memorable moments in the game when playing with others. </p>
        	<p> Install the latest version of the game. The old 2.0 original game release versions from the 90's had desync issues, and are no longer used. The latest version of the game will be what other people will have. Playing mixed versions is not possible, so it is best to use the latest version. </p>
        	<p> Next register a forum account. This will allow you to list the game through 7kfans.com for others to find. When you login and create a game when clicking 7kfans.com as the service. When using 7kfans.com the advantage will be for automatic NAT traversal, allowing you to play when a firewall is enabled. </p>
        	<p> To find opponents to play with, go to the forum. Post a message in chat, or go to popular community sites where players arrange times for matches. There is an active community of players eager to play. </p>
        	<h3><a href="#entry-0">#</a> Other ways to connect</h3>
        	<p> There are other options of available, such as LAN and direct connect, which may be used with VPN software. These are for the times when playing privately or not over the internet. VPN software does not fix issues encountered when playing over the internet. </p>
        	<h3><a href="#entry-0">#</a> Troubleshooting</h3>
        	<p> The game uses the UDP ports of 19255 and 19383. This is not the same as the original release version, so old guides prior to version 2.15 do not apply. </p>
        	<p> Most issues stem from using too strict of a firewall. Make sure you allow the 7kaa.exe game application through your firewall, and do not block the in-going and out-going traffic on those ports. The ports may change if they are in use. Also, port-forwarding is not required because NAT traversal will handle it. </p>
        	<p> Lastly, being a peer-to-peer game, the maximum latency between peers for smooth game play is 500ms. The speed of the connection does not matter on modern broadband internet. </p>

                Time for a new release! This fixes the issue with a freeze after playing long multiplayer games. If you had turned off CRC checking, please turn it back on. Other than that, multiplayer has been very smooth. This means we can start playing some bigger matches — I want to see them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other thing fixed that put defenders at a major disadvantage was concerning the game not properly assigning the leader to the defending troop. Now soldiers can defend and get an attack bonus with their leader safe in the fort also keeping peace over the population. Maybe this will balance out the game better? We’ll see.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, check out the trade report. The other thing we’d like to see is people paying attention to their markets. You can now find that caravan running between empty markets, or see the most productive markets, or set trade routes without moving around the map looking for something.

            <p> 
                With the holiday here in the US, I had a much needed break from my daily job (the one that pays the bills), that I took the opportunity to get out for a change. I made it half way through the weekend, when I remember this past weekend was also the 10th year since this project website was created.

                It’s been a pleasure with working with all of you to make this community more vibrant and active. Let’s see what’s in store in the not to far away future.
