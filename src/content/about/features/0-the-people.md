In the beginning, there are seven kings for seven peoples ... _but in the end, only one may rule_.

Each culture has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Choose any of the seven, and play against up to 6 rivals. Whatever kingdom you choose to lead, your peasants will take on their own identity. Each peasant has his own skills and loyalties, from miners and factory workers to spies, generals, scientists, and more.

The people in this game have been programmed with real human emotions. They will have conflicting or complimentary loyalties to their commanders, to their kings and to their ethnic groups. They will have the potential to rebel against unjust rule and to turn traitor and join the forces of a more just king. Or they may do the same, but only for the love of money.

Treat your people well, keep them fed, give them grants and medals, and promote the best of them to higher ranks, and they will remain steadfast, loyal, and efficient. Treat them poorly, overtax them, starve them, or earn a reputation as a militaristic tyrant, and their loyalty will suffer. And when loyalty is low, rebellion may soon follow.

As your kingdom grows, peasants from other cultures will become your subjects. Whether by military conquest of other villages, or by simple persuasion, these foreigners will join your empire, bringing with them their unique talents. But with diversity comes new challenges ...

Show favoritism to subjects of one culture, and watch as the loyalty of others rapidly declines. Each must be treated as an equal if unrest and rebellion are to be avoided. Lead them wisely, though, and your subjects will unite to form a mighty empire destined to rule the world.
