Every human in Seven Kingdoms will have his own level of skill in his profession. You may therefore see a troop of nine very well trained and well led soldiers defeat an army five or six times its size. As in the real world, a skilled commander will exercise great influence over the conduct of his forces in battle. Poorly trained troops led by an unskilled commander will be unlikely to last for very long.
