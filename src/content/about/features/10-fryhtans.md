Around the land of Seven Kingdoms may also be found the Lairs of the Fryhtans. These Lairs harbor strange and deadly beings, yet ones who must be dealt with if you would gain control of their treasures. Their Lairs hold huge amounts of gold and, most importantly, ancient scrolls of power that will enable you to build Seats of Power and then invoke Greater Beings.
