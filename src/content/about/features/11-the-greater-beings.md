The most worthy of kings may gain the ultimate power: the ability to summon the aid of the gods.

Every nationality has its own Greater Being that it will be able to summon; each with a unique power. Although these Beings are not immortal, they have powers far beyond those of humans.

Each culture worships its own Greater Being. To win the aid of any of them, you must first perform legendary deeds. The seven ancient Scrolls of Power hold the keys to winning divine favor, but the scrolls are jealously guarded by the Monster Kings. If your armies can muster the courage and might to defeat a Monster King and his gruesome minions, you may lay claim to a hoard of gold and a priceless Scroll.

With the Scroll in hand, your construction workers will master the art of building a mighty temple of worship that will strike awe into the hearts of your subjects. Send supplicants to this Seat of Power to plead for divine favor, and in time your patron god will answer the call. Then your enemies will have cause to tremble before you.
