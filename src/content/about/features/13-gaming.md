You may play Seven Kingdoms alone against the computer and its five different skill levels or else you may play against up to six other players by local area network, modem or on the Internet. There will also be a large number of preset scenarios against which you can test your skills. You may also set different goals for victory and therefore you may win by other methods than total destruction.
