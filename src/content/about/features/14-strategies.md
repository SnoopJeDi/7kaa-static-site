As in the real world you will have the choice of winning by being an unabashed militarist, conquering by brute force and damning the consequences, or you will have the choice of being a good and just king - conquering all by winning peoples hearts.

The best bet, as in the real world, will probably be somewhere in the middle. The reputation of a tyrant will probably cause his downfall before he achieves his goal and a good and just king without the force to protect himself will probably end up good and just and dead.
