The size of your armies in Seven Kingdoms will be constrained by real-world considerations. The more people you have in the armed forces, the fewer you will have to grow food and to run the economy. If you plan to draft a multitude of young soldiers you must also find good Generals to train and lead them. Generals have to be paid and rewarded. If they are not they may take their services elsewhere. You will also have to worry about the dangerous mood and potential for rebellion generated in a village when all of their young men are drafted!
