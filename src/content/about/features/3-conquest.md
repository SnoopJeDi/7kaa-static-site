Then peaceful methods fail, a king must find other ways to enforce his will ...

Warfare is a way of life for the Seven Kingdoms. Even when the kings make peace amongst themselves, there are still the ancient, monstrous Fryhtans to be reckoned with. A wise king is a well-armed king, whose powerful armies inspire fear in the hearts of his rivals. Such a king, supported by a loyal, well-trained military, can strike harder bargains in trade and diplomacy, or strike down those who are too stubborn to negotiate.

The Soldier is the foundation of the military, trained in the art of combat at your villages or in your forts. Every soldier hopes one day to earn the rank of General. Hand-pick your generals from the best of your soldiers, grant them their own forts, and raise troops. They may train in peacetime under the care of your generals, always improving their skills, or they may be sent to learn the hard way: in battle.

But even the most highly trained soldiers serving under the finest of generals cannot hope to survive marching into the waiting mouths of enemy cannons. Keep your scientists busy inventing the advanced weaponry you will need to face your toughest foes. Catapults, ballistae, cannons, and more can be constructed in your War Factories. Build harbors and ships to take your battles across the seas to distant shores. You'll need all this, and the cunning to use it well, against the rivals who want to see your kingdom ground into dust.

If you seek treasure to fill your coffers, you'll have to tangle with the deadly Fryhtans. These horrible beasts know no fear, guarding in their foul lairs vast sums of gold and, some say, the secrets of the gods themselves. Slay a king of the Fryhtans and great powers may be yours for the taking. Such power could turn the tide of war in your kingdom's favor, if your armies can survive to claim it.
