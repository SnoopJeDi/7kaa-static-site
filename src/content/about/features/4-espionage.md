The Spy is every king's most versatile and devious tool ...

In Seven Kingdoms you will have the opportunity to infiltrate spies into the kingdoms of your enemies. Here, in villages, factories, towers of science, mines and forts they can sleep as moles until the time is right to complete their missions. They may sow discord, sabotage production or research, steal information, or rise in the ranks of an enemy army even to the level of General. A well placed spy may even gain the throne of an enemy's kingdom and thus secure victory without a fight. You are not without defense against these spies, however, as you may keep your own counterspies in your possessions to expose and execute these enemy agents.

Spies offer a cunning king a bloodless path to victory. Used wisely, a spy can do anything from gathering information about your rivals' activities to infiltrating the uppermost ranks of their military. Train spies at home and assign them the guise of any of your rivals' subjects. Then they will be free to move amongst the enemy, working in his factories, training in his command bases, all the while reporting back to you and answering to your commands.

A skillful spy can bribe enemies into secretly entering your service, persuade peasants and workers to rebel against their king, capture buildings, and sabotage production. But every spy's ultimate aspiration is to win a promotion to General of a rival army, and secretly turn the enemies' armies against one another. And if a rival's king should be killed, then maybe, just maybe, such a spy could ascend to the throne, and hand the keys of the kingdom over to you, his true master.

But the life of a spy is full of hazards and pitfalls. Constantly at risk of discovery, these brave agents might be caught and executed at any time. The best will serve their master well, and survive to reap the rewards. Those less skillful will perish long before.

And of course yours will not be the only kingdom with spies afoot. Any one of your 'loyal' subjects might actually be a spy for the opposition, spreading dissension in your ranks. You can station your own spies at home as counter-espionage agents to watch for signs of infiltration and subterfuge. Catch the enemy in the act, and you can execute his agents at will.
