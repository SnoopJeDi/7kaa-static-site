Even the strongest and most cunning of kings must sometimes depend on the aid of others.

Diplomacy can play a large role in Seven Kingdoms. You will be able to make and break trade treaties, friendly treaties or alliance treaties. You may declare war or sue for peace, demand tribute or beg for aid or food.

To gain the power to rule all the land, a king may find it necessary to call on the support of one of his rivals. Perhaps a trade treaty would be to both kingdoms' advantage. Or perhaps an alliance would deter other kingdoms from harassing you.

Exploit any of dozens of diplomatic options. Form friendships and alliances to secure your kingdom from the dangers of war. Propose treaties to promote economic growth. Barter for food if your stores are depleted. Join other kingdoms to impose a trade embargo on a hated enemy, or request a declaration of war from your allies.

Rival kings are not easily manipulated in matters of diplomacy. Deal fairly with them, and you will build a strong reputation that will serve you well. But betray them, and they will remember your misdeeds and turn their people and your own against you. And remember that even the strongest of alliances must eventually be broken, because in the end, only one of you may rule the land.
