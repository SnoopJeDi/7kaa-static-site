Gold is the foundation of power, and trade is a king's greatest source of gold.

Instead of concentrating solely on military matters you may wish to spend time creating a trading empire of mines, factories, markets, caravans, harbors and ships that span the known world. This will bring you far more income than the feudal method of simply taxing your peasants, although this is also an option.

If you wish to rule the Seven Peoples, you must first master the art of trade. To gain sufficient wealth to rule as you please, you will need markets overflowing with goods and commerce. Import raw materials from other kingdoms' marketplaces, or build mines to produce your own. Convert raw materials into finished goods in your factories, and transport these goods to your marketplaces for sale. A wise king can turn a profit in each of these transactions, and fill his coffers with gold to fuel his dreams of conquest.

Caravans are the backbone of your trade system, carrying raw materials and goods from place to place. When distances are short, buildings can be linked together to share resources without the help of caravans, but when distances are very great, even caravans may not be enough. Build harbors and trade ships to carry your goods to distant shores.

Trade can also be a useful tool for persuading independent villages to join your kingdom. Build a marketplace for them and sell your goods there, and you will not only reap the profits but also win their loyalty.
