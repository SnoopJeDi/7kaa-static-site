These villages are prizes far exceeding the value of gold as it is with a multi-cultural empire, making use of the unique skills of each nationality, that will have the advantage in this game. Seven Kingdoms recognizes that people, their skills and their loyalties are by far the most precious resource in the real world and so we have tried to emphasize that aspect over the simple gathering of minerals.
