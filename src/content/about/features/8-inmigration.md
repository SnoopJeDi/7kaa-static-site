Even if you do not desire to absorb these villages into your empire, you may receive a steady flow of immigrants from them if your kingdom is perceived to be a good place to live. As with the people in the empires, independent villagers all have their own human feelings which can sometimes lead them to uprooting and moving to a better place. It is therefore a good strategy to make your kingdom the most desirable in the world.
