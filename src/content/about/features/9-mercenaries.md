In Seven Kingdoms you may also make use of mercenaries that you may hire in your inns. These mercenaries are skilled workers, soldiers or scientists looking for the kingdom that will pay him the most. You must be careful, however, as at times a mercenary's obvious skills may hide the fact that he is actually a spy in the pay of an enemy kingdom.
